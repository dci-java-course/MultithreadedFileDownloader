Input: Allow the user to provide a list of URLs to download and specify the number of threads to use for downloading.

Multithreading: Create and manage multiple threads, each responsible for downloading a specific file from the list of URLs.

Download Progress: Display the download progress for each file, including the percentage of completion.

Exception Handling: Implement proper error handling to deal with exceptions such as invalid URLs, network errors, or file access issues. Log any exceptions that occur.
