# Review the effect of INDEXes on query using EXPLAIN and ANALYZE

> **Create an index on an important column that is frequently used in the query**

***Hint:***
- Create a single column index on *c_id* of the *tblDummy* table created in exercise-1.

> **Clear cache and analyse a query** 

***Hint:***
- Analyze the same query as used in exercise-1 to see the effect of caching. Here the purpose is to verify the effect of indexing.

> **Note results**

> check the blocks read from the disk

> **Analyse the same query, again**

> **Note results and compare with previous results**

> Also, recheck the blocks read from the disk
